Hey there!  
I’m Yaser, but I go by Kael.

I’m a Computer Science student who enjoys building things with code and learning how software actually works by doing it. If an idea comes to mind, I usually try to turn it into a small project and improve it step by step.

Most of the repositories here are part of my learning journey. I focus on writing cleaner code, understanding logic better, and getting comfortable with real development workflows instead of just following tutorials.

Right now, I’m mainly working with Python and building practical beginner-to-intermediate projects. I care more about consistency and long-term improvement than rushing or showing off.

You’ll find a few pinned projects here — they’re the ones I’ve learned the most from so far.

Still learning, still building, one project at a time.
